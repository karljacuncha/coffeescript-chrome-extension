coffeescript-chrome-extension
=============================

Pre-requisites: node.js, coffee-script & stylus

To get started, run `cake build` then open `index.html` in the `pkg` directory.

Code is all in literate coffee script, so all the information you need should
be in there, all very straight forward and clear with any silliness whatsoever,
I can certainly assure you of that
